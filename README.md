# DNTK (DNToolKit)
This is the C# backend for DNTK (i also dont really know what the name is an acronym of tbh)


# RSAKey
You need to bring your own RSA Key(extracted from the client) if the one in this repo does not work.
If so, you can place the rsa key in the config.json in the same directory

MAKE SURE YOU LAUNCH DNTK BEFORE YOU LOGIN (CLICK THE DOOR)

if the default network interface is not the right one, you can toggle the choose option in config.json



config.json is regenerated on first launch



This works as a backend for iridium


Currently it is updated for version 3.7 of SomeAnimeGame
